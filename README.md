## Project Details:

Tamagochi.XLM is a blockchain-based virtual pet game built on the Stellar network.
Inspired by the classic Tamagotchi, this project lets users adopt, feed, and grow digital pets â€” but with blockchain ownership and token mechanics.
Each petâ€™s state (health, happiness, energy) is stored securely on-chain, ensuring true digital ownership and permanence.
Players can interact with their pets through transactions, level up, and earn rewards using Stellar smart contracts written in Rust.
The frontend uses **React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS** for an engaging and modern game interface.

## Vision:

Tamagochi.XLM envisions a future where gaming meets decentralized ownership.
By combining nostalgic fun with blockchain transparency, the project empowers users to truly own their digital pets â€” not just play with them.
With Stellarâ€™s fast and low-cost transactions, every interaction feels instant and meaningful.
Our mission is to create a gamified ecosystem that celebrates digital life, creativity, and community through transparent Web3 technology.

## Description:

Tamagochi.XLM brings the joy of nurturing a virtual pet into the blockchain era.
Players can adopt pets, feed them, play, and monitor their well-being â€” all stored as verifiable data on Stellar.
Each pet is represented by a token, giving it value and ownership on the blockchain.
Smart contracts handle key actions like feeding, leveling, and token rewards.
The project integrates a smooth React + Rust interface to make decentralized gaming accessible and engaging.
Itâ€™s not just a game â€” itâ€™s a digital companion that lives on the Stellar network.

## About Stellar:

Stellar provides the foundation for Tamagochi.XLMâ€™s gameplay and token economy.
Its fast transactions and minimal fees make it ideal for real-time game interactions.
By leveraging Stellarâ€™s smart contract capabilities (Soroban), the project ensures transparency and fairness in every pet action and transaction.
Tamagochi.XLM demonstrates how blockchain can be playful, educational, and empowering all at once.

---

## Project Plan:

1. **Smart Contract Design:** Define structures for `Pet`, `Action`, and `Reward` using Rust and Soroban on Stellar.
2. **Core Functions:** Implement pet creation, feeding, play actions, energy management, and level-up logic.
3. **Token Integration:** Connect actions to a native reward token for activity incentives.
4. **Frontend Development:** Build a React + TypeScript UI for managing pets, actions, and token balances.
5. **Testing:** Create unit tests for contracts and simulate interactions between frontend and blockchain.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy contracts to Stellar testnet and host the frontend via Vercel or Netlify.

## Story Summary:

As a developer who grew up with Tamagotchi, I wanted to reimagine that nostalgic experience through blockchain.
Tamagochi.XLM was born out of my love for interactive digital worlds and the belief that players should truly own what they create.
Using Stellar, I built a transparent and playful ecosystem where pets live on-chain â€” a blend of technology, emotion, and decentralization.
